# Valuing Physical Gold in EUR for Box 3 – 2024

This page explains how to calculate the euro value of physical gold (coins or bars) for your Dutch **Box 3** tax return as of **1 January 2024**, using published reference data accepted by the Belastingdienst.

## 🧾 Use Holland Gold’s annual tax valuation table

Dutch investors holding physical precious metals can use the official prices published by **Holland Gold** in their yearly PDF titled:

> **Belastingaangifte Edelmetaal 2024**

This document provides euro values for common gold and silver coins/bars based on the **LBMA fixing** of **29 December 2023**—the last business day before the 1 January reference date (*peildatum*). These values are pre-converted to euros using the **ECB exchange rate**, so **no additional currency conversion is needed**.

## 🧮 How to use it in your tax return

1. **Count** how many coins or bars you hold.  
2. **Multiply** by the matching euro value from the table.  
3. Report the result in Box 3 under **“Overige bezittingen – edelmetalen”**.  
4. No further FX conversion or appraisal needed.

✅ These values already include:
- The correct **LBMA gold price**
- The **ECB exchange rate** for USD/EUR on 29 Dec 2023
- The mandatory “omrekenkoers” adjustment required by the Belastingdienst

### 📌 Example

If you hold **3 × 1 oz Maple Leaf coins**:

3 × €1 865.44 = €5 596.32


Use **€5 596.32** as the total value of your gold holdings on 1 January 2024.

## ⚠️ Notes & caveats

- These values reflect **bullion/melt value** only — collector premiums are ignored for tax purposes.
- If your metal is stored with a different provider, ensure it matches the listed specifications (e.g., weight, purity).
- The Holland Gold PDF carries the usual disclaimer that no legal rights can be derived from it — but it has been widely accepted by the Dutch tax authority over many years.
