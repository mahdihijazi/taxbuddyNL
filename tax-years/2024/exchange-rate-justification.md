# Exchange Rate Justification (USD to EUR)

## Why use 0.904977 EUR per USD?

To convert USD balances for Dutch **Box 3** tax reporting on **1 January 2024**, we use **€ 0.904977 per USD**. This rate comes from the **ECB’s official reference rate on 29 December 2023**—the last working day before the peildatum.

> There is no ECB rate published on 1 January since it’s a TARGET banking holiday. The Belastingdienst accepts using the most recent published ECB rate.

## Legal & procedural basis

- The **Belastingdienst** requires that non-euro assets be converted using the **ECB reference rate applicable on 1 January** of the tax year.
- Since 1 January 2024 was a public holiday, the rate from **29 December 2023** is used instead.
- This approach is consistent with the Belastingdienst's own “wisselkoersen aangifte” table and historical guidance.

## Source: ECB reference rate (29 Dec 2023)

The ECB published the following rate for USD:

USD — US dollar — 1.1050

This means:

> **1 euro = 1.1050 USD**

To convert **USD to EUR**, invert the rate:

1 / 1.1050 = 0.904977 EUR per USD

## On rounding

The Belastingdienst’s public rate table rounds this to **0.9033**, but using the **exact inverse (0.904977)** is acceptable and often more accurate—**as long as you can provide documentation** (e.g., the original ECB source).

## How this is used in the prompt

All USD-denominated account balances—Wise, Revolut, Interactive Brokers, etc.—are multiplied by **0.904977** to determine their **euro value as of 1 January 2024 at 00:00**.

This note, along with the ECB source, should be sufficient to justify your conversion method if requested during a tax audit.
