# TaxBuddyNL

*A Dutch Tax Assistant — lightning-quick Box 3 calculator today*

---

## ✨ What is TaxBuddyNL?

**TaxBuddyNL** started life as a personal prompt for estimating Dutch **Box 3** tax. The project now keeps a **versioned prompt per tax year** so the right allowances and fictitious-return rates are always at hand.

## 📂 Where do I start?

1. Choose your tax year inside **[`tax-years/`](tax-years/)**. The latest **fully-populated** release is **[`tax-years/2024/`](tax-years/2024/)** (also aliased by the symlink **`tax-years/latest`**).
2. If you want to prepare 2025, use **[`tax-years/2025/`](tax-years/2025/)** as a **draft template** and fill in the official 2025 values listed in its checklist.
3. Open that folder’s **`README.md`** for a year-specific quick-start, configuration block, and the complete prompt.
4. Copy **`prompt.txt`**, fill in your personal figures, paste it into ChatGPT (or any GPT-o3/4-equivalent model) along with your PDF statements.
5. Receive a formatted Box 3 calculation you can transfer to MijnBelastingdienst.

That’s all you need for now. Future folders will appear here as new tax seasons roll in.
